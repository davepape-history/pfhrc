A Softimage (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Softimage) HRC loader developed for Performer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Performer). The loader reads a Softimage model (.hrc file), and creates a Performer scene graph for the model. It was used to import Softimage models into Performer/CAVE applications. The loader is a standard pfdb DSO library, so it could be used with regular Performer applications, such as perfly.
